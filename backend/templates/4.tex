{\color{royalblue} \section{RESEARCH\\EXPERIENCE}}
\textbf{\textcolor {royalblue} {Tuning of Thermal Conductivity of Monolayer Gallium Nitride Nano-ribbon: An Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics Study}}\\
Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics simulations using Stillinger-Weber potential has been deployed to compute the thermal conductivity of the nanometer-sized zigzag monolayer GaN nano-ribbon(NR). Thermal transport dependence of monolayer GaN-NR on the variation of length and width are explored. Furthermore, the impact of aluminium and indium doping on the thermal conductivity of monolayer GaN-NR are also investigated.
